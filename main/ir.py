# This code can be run as python2 or python3 in most systems.
#
# This is a small program that runs two processes, connecting the stdin of each
# one to the stdout of the other.
# It doesn't perform a lot of checking, so many errors may
# be caught internally by Python (e.g., if your command line has incorrect
# syntax) or not caught at all (e.g., if the judge or solution hangs).
#
# Run this as:
# python interactive_runner.py <cmd_line_judge> -- <cmd_line_solution>
#
# For example, if you have a testing_tool.py in python3 (that takes a single
# integer as a command line parameter) to use as judge -- like one
# downloaded from a problem statement -- and you would run your solution
# in a standalone using one of the following:
#   1. python3 my_solution.py
#   2. ./my_solution
#   3. java Solution
#   4. my_solution.exe
# Then you could run the judge and solution together, using this, as:
#   1. python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py 0 -- python3 my_solution.py
#   2. python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py 0 -- ./my_solution
#   3. python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py 0 -- java solution
#   4. python interactive_runner.py python3 testing_tool.py 0 -- my_solution.exe
# Notice that the solution in cases 2, 3 and 4 would usually have a
# compilation step before running, which you should run in your usual way
# before using this tool.
#
# This is only intended as a convenient tool to help contestants test solutions
# locally. In particular, it is not identical to the implementation on our
# server, which is more complex.
#
# The standard streams are handled the following way:
# - judge's stdin is connected to the solution's stdout;
# - judge's stdout is connected to the solution's stdin;
# - stderrs of both judge and solution are piped to standard error stream, with
#   lines prepended by "judge: " or "sol: " respectively (note, no
#   synchronization is done so it's possible for the messages from both programs
#   to overlap with each other).
